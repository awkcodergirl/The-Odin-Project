## Skills Learned
- The importance of pre-planning my solution
- @media query usage to make the design more responsive 
- Splitting the code into functions that allowed me to break down the functionality into smaller chunks, and each function performed a different task 
- Taking 10-20 minutes breaks from my computer allowed me to think more clearly
