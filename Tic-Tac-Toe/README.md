## Skills Learned
- The importance of pre-planning my solution
- Using the module pattern to make gameBoard which contains all the functions relevant to the game board
- Using the factory pattern to make the player object and update score board
- Tucking all the variables inside functions or the module so there is no global code
- Having a detectClicks() method that calls the appropriate functions when a button is pressed
- @media query usage to make the design more responsive 
- Splitting the code into functions that allowed me to break down the functionality into smaller chunks, and each function performed a different task 
- Taking 10-20 minutes breaks from my computer allowed me to think more clearly
